# Shop Page

The **Shop page** is the centerpiece of your beauty store â€” where visitors explore and fall in love with your skincare products.  
In **Skinelle**, the Shop page is powered by **WooCommerce blocks** and designed with a clean, luxurious layout that highlights your products beautifully.


## Setting Up the Shop Page

* Go to **Pages â†’ Add New**.  
* Enter a title â€” for example, **Shop**.  
* Keep the **template** as **Default** (no custom template needed).  
* Click **Publish** to save your new page.  


## Assigning the Shop Page in WooCommerce

* Navigate to **WooCommerce â†’ Settings â†’ Products**.  
* Under the **General** tab, find the **Shop page** setting.  
* From the dropdown menu, select the **Shop** page you just created.  
* Click **Save Changes**.  

This ensures WooCommerce recognizes your newly created page as the main product catalog.  

## Customizing the Shop Layout

* Go to **Appearance â†’ Editor â†’ Templates**.  
* Open the **Shop** or **Product Archive** template.  
* Use the **block editor** to adjust the layout to match your brand style:  
    * Change the number of products displayed per row.  
    * Add banners or featured collections to promote bestsellers or new arrivals.  
    * Adjust sorting and filtering options for smoother browsing.  
* Click **Save** once your layout is ready.
