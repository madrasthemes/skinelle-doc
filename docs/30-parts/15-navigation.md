# Navigation

The **navigation menu** helps visitors explore your beauty store effortlessly â€” from skincare collections to product categories and blog posts.  
In **Skinelle**, navigation is built entirely with **WordPress blocks**, giving you full control to design elegant and intuitive menus directly from the **Site Editor**.


## Accessing the Navigation

* Go to **Appearance â†’ Editor â†’ Navigation**.  
* Youâ€™ll see a list of all existing navigation menus used across your site.  
* Select an existing menu to edit, or click **Add New** to create a fresh navigation menu for your store.

## Editing the Menu

* Click any menu item to **rename** it or **link** it to a page, product category, or custom URL.  
* Use the **+ (Add Block)** button to add new links or create dropdowns for organized navigation.  
* Drag and drop menu items to **reorder** them.  
* To create **submenus**, simply nest items beneath a parent link â€” perfect for organizing skincare routines, beauty tips, or product types.

## Assigning the Menu

* Once your navigation menu is ready, go to **Appearance â†’ Editor â†’ Patterns â†’ All Template Parts**.  
* Open the **Header** template part.  
* Replace or assign the **Navigation block** with the one you created.  

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* You can design multiple menus â€” for example, a **main header menu** for shopping links and a **footer menu** for support or policy pages. Easily switch between them anytime from the Navigation screen.
