# Header

The **header** is one of the most important elements of your website â€” itâ€™s the first thing visitors see and helps them navigate your beauty store with ease.  

In **Skinelle**, the header is built entirely using **WordPress blocks**, allowing you to easily customize its design, layout, and functionality through the **Site Editor** â€” no coding required.  


### Accessing and Editing the Header

* Go to **Appearance â†’ Editor â†’ Patterns â†’ All Template Parts**.  
* Under **All Template Parts**, locate **Header**.  
* Click on **Header** to open it in the editor, where you can modify or replace it with one of the pre-designed **Header patterns** provided by Skinelle.  


### Key Features

* **Logo:** Upload your brand logo and link it to your homepage.  
* **Navigation Menu:** Customize menus for product categories, collections, or pages.  
* **Search Bar:** Allow users to quickly find products or skincare routines.  
* **Mini Cart:** Show items added to the cart for smooth shopping flow.

### Customizing the Header

* Use the **Block Editor** to add, remove, or rearrange header elements such as menus, icons, or buttons.
