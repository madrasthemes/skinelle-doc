# Home Pages

## Homepage Setup

**Skinelle** includes **5 beautifully designed homepage layouts**, each crafted as a **block pattern**.
This setup allows you to create your homepage quickly and effortlessly — simply select the pattern you love, and it will load the complete homepage layout instantly. Each layout has been carefully designed to suit different styles of skincare and beauty stores, giving your website a refined and professional look.

Since all homepages are built as **patterns**, you can assign them to a page with just a few clicks — no need to assemble sections manually.

### Creating and Assigning Your Homepage

Follow these simple steps to create and assign your homepage:

#### **Step 1: Create a Homepage**

* Go to **Pages → Add New**.
* When prompted with the **“Choose a Pattern”** pop-up, you can select from the available **Skinelle homepage patterns** — each one is a complete, ready-to-use layout.
  This makes it easy to set up your homepage instantly without building it block by block.
* Alternatively, close the pop-up if you prefer to start with a blank page.
* Give your page a title, such as **Home**.
* Click **Publish** to save it.

💡 *Tip:* Selecting a **full homepage pattern** at this stage automatically loads a complete layout, allowing you to begin customizing right away.


#### **Step 2: Assign a Template to the Home Page**

* Open the page you created.
* In the **right sidebar**, under the **Page** tab, find the **Template** option.
* Click **Change Template**, then select one of the following:

  * **Canvas Template** – Use this if you want to manually insert a separate header and footer for this page.

  * **Page No Title Template** – Use this to apply the **global header and footer** across your entire site.
    <!--![Page No Title Template](/img/page-no-title-template.webp)-->
* Click **Preview** to see how your homepage looks with the chosen template.


### Add Patterns to Your Page

You can further customize your homepage by adding more **patterns**.

Each complete homepage layout is available as a **single pattern**, so you can load it instantly — or mix and match smaller section patterns (like banners, hero sliders, featured products, or testimonials) to design your ideal beauty store homepage.

* Open the **Block Inserter (+)** in the editor.
* Navigate to **Patterns → Skinelle**.
* Choose your preferred **Home pattern** (e.g., *Home v1, Home v2, Home v3, Home v4,* or *Home v5*).

### About the Header

The **header** in Skinelle is fully block-based and can be customized through the **Site Editor**.
Each homepage pattern comes with its own **header style**, carefully designed to match that homepage’s visual tone and layout.

* Go to **Appearance → Editor → Templates → Header**.
* Select from the available **Header patterns** or customize an existing one using block controls.
* You can modify elements like the **logo, navigation menu, search bar, mini cart,** and **account icon** directly within the editor.

This flexibility lets you create a stylish and functional header that perfectly aligns with your skincare brand’s look and feel.

### Creating a Blog Page

To set up a dedicated page for your blog posts:

* Go to **Pages → Add New**.
* Title the page **Blog**.
* Keep the **Template** set to **Default**.
* Click **Publish**.

💡 *Tip:* Keeping your blog separate from the homepage allows you to share skincare tips, beauty routines, and product guides in an organized, reader-friendly way.
