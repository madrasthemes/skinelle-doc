## General

### Where is my license key?

The **Skinelle** theme does not require a license key to function.  
Simply install and activate the theme, and you’re ready to begin customizing your beauty store.


### What is the logo font?

The logo font used in the **Skinelle demo** is chosen for its **elegant and minimal aesthetic**, ideal for beauty and skincare brands.  
You can easily replace it with any custom font that matches your brand’s style by editing the logo text or uploading a logo image in the **Header section**.


### Does Skinelle support multi-vendors?

No, **Skinelle** is a **WooCommerce-based theme** and supports all core WooCommerce features.  
Multi-vendor management is not a built-in WooCommerce feature.  
However, you can use third-party plugins such as [Dokan](https://dokan.co/wordpress/) or [WC Vendors](https://www.wcvendors.com/) to enable multi-vendor functionality.
