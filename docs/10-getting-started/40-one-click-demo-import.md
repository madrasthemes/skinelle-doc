# One Click Demo Import

To help you get started quickly, **Skinelle** supports a **one-click demo import** feature. This allows you to import all demo content — including **Home pages**, **Static pages**, **Blog posts**, and **Menus** — so your site looks exactly like our [Skinelle Live Demo](https://skinelle.madrasthemes.com/).

This process will set up your website just like the demo version, saving you time and giving you a clear starting point to customize your store.

## Steps to Import Demo Content

1. **Install the Theme and Plugins**
   Ensure that you’ve installed and activated the **Skinelle** theme, along with all the recommended plugins under
   **Appearance → Install Plugins**.

2. **Access the Import Tool**
   Navigate to **Appearance → Import Demo Data** in your WordPress dashboard.

3. **Run the Import**
   Click on the **Import Demo Data** button. The process will automatically import demo homepages, shop pages, blog posts, menus, and widgets.

4. **Wait for Completion**
   Sit back and relax — the import process may take a few minutes depending on your server speed. Once it’s done, you’ll see a confirmation message indicating that the demo content has been successfully imported.

After the import is complete, your site will look like the **Skinelle demo**, and you can start customizing it with your own products, brand colors, and images.
