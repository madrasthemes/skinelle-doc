# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation for **Skinelle – Skincare & Beauty Products WooCommerce Theme**.

Thank you for choosing **Skinelle**! We’ve crafted this theme with care, precision, and a touch of elegance to help you create a stunning online store for skincare, cosmetics, and wellness products. This guide will walk you through the main features of **Skinelle**, along with instructions on how to install, use, and customize it to match your brand perfectly.


## About the Theme

**Skinelle** is a modern, elegant WooCommerce theme thoughtfully designed for skincare and beauty stores. Whether you’re building an online boutique for organic cosmetics, a luxury skincare brand, or a multi-category beauty marketplace, **Skinelle** provides the perfect foundation to showcase your products beautifully.

Built as a **block-based Full Site Editing (FSE)** theme, **Skinelle** leverages `theme.json`, advanced block patterns, and reusable style variations to give you complete control over your store’s design — without touching a single line of code.

Performance is a top priority — inline styles, optimized images, and a minified global stylesheet ensure fast loading speeds and a smooth browsing experience across all devices.


## Theme Philosophy

Over the years, **WordPress theme development** has evolved, but one principle remains constant:
A theme should define **how your site looks**, not **how it functions**.

At **Skinelle**, we’ve built around this philosophy. The theme focuses purely on **styling** WordPress and WooCommerce blocks, leaving the functionality to plugins — ensuring flexibility and long-term compatibility.

For example, **Skinelle** doesn’t create or manage contact forms, sliders, or pop-ups. Instead, it styles them beautifully so you can freely use your preferred plugins, such as **WPForms**, **Contact Form 7**, or **MailPoet**, without losing design consistency.

This approach keeps your website lightweight, easily upgradable, and fully customizable.
