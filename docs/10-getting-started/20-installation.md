## Download the Theme

After completing your purchase, you can download the theme files from one of the following locations:

**ThemeForest customers**: [ThemeForest downloads](https://themeforest.net/downloads)

**MadrasThemes.com customers**: [Downloads page](https://madrasthemes.com/account/?action=downloads)

:::**Important:**
If you purchased the theme from ThemeForest, make sure to download the **Installable WordPress file only**.
Downloading the full theme package may lead to a **“missing style.css”** error during installation.
