# Using Demo Content

Demo content is a great way to get started quickly and see how your website will look with real data. **Skinelle**’s homepages and other pages are built using **Block Patterns**, so you don’t need to import an entire demo site. Instead, you can choose to add only the pages or sections you need by selecting the relevant **Starter** pattern.


## Starter Patterns

We recommend importing demo products and blog posts **only if your website is brand new** or doesn’t yet have any content.
If you already have your own products or blog posts, you can simply use the available **page patterns** to create and design the pages you need.

## Demo Shop Products

**Skinelle** includes beautifully crafted demo products designed to help you visualize your skincare store’s structure and layout. These demo products are fully compatible with **WooCommerce** and showcase how your product grids, single product pages, and categories will appear using the theme’s design.

### Key Points:

* Demo products are **optional** — import them only if your store doesn’t have actual products yet.
* They help you **preview the theme’s features** such as product listings, category layouts, and shop sections.
* You can **replace demo products** with your real ones at any time without affecting the design or layout.
* All demo products are designed to reflect the **beauty and skincare niche**, ensuring a realistic preview for your store setup.


## Demo Blog Posts

**Skinelle** also includes sample blog posts that help you visualize how your blog section will look once populated. These demo posts showcase the theme’s clean and elegant blog layouts, perfect for sharing skincare tips, product guides, or beauty routines.

### Key Points:

* Demo posts are **optional** — import them only if your site doesn’t have any blog content yet.
* Importing them helps you **see how your blog will appear** with featured images, excerpts, and category filters.
* You can **replace demo posts** anytime with your own articles or tutorials without affecting the theme’s style.
