# Updating the Theme

Keeping your **Skinelle** theme up to date ensures you have access to the latest design improvements, new features, and important security fixes. Updating regularly helps maintain compatibility with the latest versions of **WordPress** and **WooCommerce**.

There are multiple ways to update the theme depending on how it was originally installed.


### Recommended Update Methods

#### **Via WordPress Dashboard (Zip Upload)**

1. Download the latest version of `skinelle.zip` from your [ThemeForest Downloads](https://themeforest.net/downloads) or [MadrasThemes Account](https://madrasthemes.com/account/?action=downloads).
2. In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Appearance → Themes**.
3. Click **Add New → Upload Theme**.
4. Upload the new `.zip` file. WordPress will automatically detect that **Skinelle** is already installed and prompt you to **replace it**.
5. Click **Replace current with uploaded** to complete the update.


#### **Via FTP**

1. Unzip the latest `skinelle.zip` file on your computer.
2. Connect to your hosting server using an FTP client such as **FileZilla**.
3. Navigate to the `wp-content/themes` directory.
4. Upload the updated `skinelle` folder, replacing the existing one.
5. Once the upload is complete, go back to your WordPress dashboard to confirm the update.


### Important Notes

* **Backup first:** Always create a backup of your website (both files and database) before performing any updates.
* **Child theme users:** If you are using a child theme for customizations, your changes will remain safe and unaffected by the update.
* **Clear cache:** After updating, clear both your website cache and browser cache to ensure you see the latest version of your theme.
